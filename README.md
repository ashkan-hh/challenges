# ThinkOnward Challenges 

Welcome to the [ThinkOnward Challenges](https://thinkonward.com/app/c/challenges/) repository. This collection houses the results and starter notebooks for our exciting Challenges and Bounties focused on geoscience and energy analysis. Each Challenge or Bounty comes complete with a handy starter notebook, along with any required files or assets.

Winning submissions from our community are also included, organized by team name, so you can explore their creative solutions! üèÜ‚ú®

Feel free to check out the code and notebooks to learn more about these fascinating projects. Happy coding!

This repository is organized into several sections, each focusing on different geoscience-related projects such as image analysis, energy forecasting, and more. Each project includes a starter notebook, utilities, and sometimes additional resources like checkpoints or datasets. 

To get started with any of these projects, you will typically need to clone the repository and run the provided starter notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter). Make sure to install the dependencies listed in each `requirements.txt` file if necessary.

If you encounter any issues or have questions about a specific project, please open an issue on GitHub or a discussion on the [forum](https://forum.thinkonward.com/)
